# 0800 Pancho's website

This repository contains the source code for the website of Argentinian beat maker, [0800 Pancho](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfJSpXKG2XWILMDP41XxmnQ). The site is built using [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/).

From T3 Stack's technologies, it was used:
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) for the frontend
* [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org) for authentication
* [Prisma](https://prisma.io) for the database
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling

With Next.js, the website is built using server-side rendering, allowing for fast and efficient page loads. NextAuth provides secure authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can access admin panel. Prisma is used as an ORM to interact with the database and manage the data efficiently. The database is powered by [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com), ensuring scalability and reliability. Tailwind CSS is used for styling, allowing for fast and efficient development while providing a modern and responsive design.
